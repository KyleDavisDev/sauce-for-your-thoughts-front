# Hello World!

This is the source code for the **Sauce For Your Thoughts** front-end.

# Install

Run `npm install` to download all of the necessary packages.

# Requirements

This application was built on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version `v12.13.0`.

# Usage

To run in development, type `npm run dev` in console to start (NextJS)[https://nextjs.org/]. This will compile your code and allow for hot reloading.
